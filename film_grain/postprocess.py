"""
Post-processing: perceptual grain visibility and characteristic curves.

The Boolean model produces physically correct grain density, but two additional
factors shape the look of real film that are worth modeling:

1. CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (H&D curve):
   Real film has a non-linear response to light. The S-shaped curve compresses
   shadows (toe) and highlights (shoulder), with a roughly linear middle.
   This affects where grain is most visible.

2. PERCEPTUAL VISIBILITY:
   Grain visibility depends on local contrast and tonal zone. The Boolean
   model's variance naturally follows p(1-p) (maximum at midtones), but
   real film has an asymmetry: grain is more perceptually prominent in the
   shadow-to-midtone range. Deep shadows are clean (unexposed film base),
   and dense highlights merge into smooth continuous tone.

These are applied as optional post-processing after the Boolean model render.

    Apply a simplified film characteristic curve (H&D curve).

    Maps linear input through an S-curve that compresses shadows (toe) and

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_float : ndarray, float, [0, 1]
        Normalized input image.
    toe_strength : float
        Shadow compression. Higher = more compressed shadows.

    """
    Modulate grain amplitude based on tonal zone.

    The Boolean model gives physically correct grain density, but perceptual
    grain visibility in real film prints has a specific pattern:
      - Deep shadows: clean (few exposed crystals on negative)
      - Lower midtones: grain emerges
      - Midtones: maximum grain visibility
      - Upper highlights: grain very dense but merges to smooth tone

    This function scales the grain component (deviation from expected value)
    by a zone-dependent weight, preserving the average tone while adjusting
    texture visibility.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rendered : ndarray, float, [0, 1]
        Boolean model output.
    original_normalized : ndarray, float, [0, 1]
        The expected (noise-free) tone at each pixel.
    shadow_floor : float
        Minimum grain weight in deep shadows (0 = no grain, 1 = full).
    shadow_ramp_end : float
        Luminance at which grain reaches full strength (coming up from black).
    highlight_ramp_start : float
        Luminance at which grain starts rolling off toward highlights.
    highlight_floor : float
        Minimum grain weight in bright highlights.
